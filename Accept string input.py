#You need to write a program which does the following

    #• Accepts 2 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 1st line as the variables A, В

    #• Accepts 3 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 2nd line as the variables C, D, E

    #• Accepts 4 space separated alphanumeric strings as input in 3rd line as the variables F, G, H, I

    #• Prints out 9 space separated strings as output in a single line to the console


A, B = input().split()
C, D, E = input().split()
F, G, H, I = input().split()
print(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)
